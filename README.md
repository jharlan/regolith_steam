# About #

An asteroid mining roguelike.

You mine pink and yellow minerals for coins.
You mine blue water that is used as fuel for steam power.
You mine brown regolith for shielding against solar wind.

Moving to an asteroid starts the mining process.

The shield and fuel costs are designated as brown or blue numbers in the center map.  When you cross the numbers, your shields and fuel are decreased that amount.

High brown numbers indicate intense solar wind.  High blue numbers indicate distant asteroids.
